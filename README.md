# Predictive Analytics for Medical Insurance Fraud

## Project Overview
This project was created by my team (DBA3803 Group 6) at the National University of Singapore, aimed at tackling a binary classification problem of predicting the likelihood of fraudulent insurance claims in Zimbabwe using machine learning algorithms. We seek to address the issue of fraudulent medical insurance claims through predictive analytics, identify key predictors of fradulent claims and thus effectively reduce the financial losses borne by health insurance companies in Zimbabwe.

## Problem Statement
The economic crisis in Zimbabwe has severely impacted the healthcare system, leading to underfunding and forcing patients to bear the costs of previously free services. This shift has strained health insurance companies, which now face increased claims and higher operational costs. Additionally, fraudulent claims exacerbate these challenges, as evidenced by CIMAS Medical Aid Society's $1.5 million loss from fraudulent medical aid claims.
